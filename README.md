# Rat Music
Desktop Music Player Application </br>

Technologies : Java, mySql</br>

As with many music projects, our aim is to make users listen to music in the easiest way. Users enter the system with their passwords and usernames. If they don’t have any account, users can register to system. After entering the system, users encounter an easy-to-use interface.</br>

In this interface users can </br>
•	search music</br>
•	play music</br>
•	create own playlist</br>
•	add new music into the database and delete music in database</br>

System hide the playlist of each user and show it when they enter the system again</br>
